# User Stories for New Post Notification Feature

## Story 1: Real-time New Post Detection
**As a** user browsing the social media feed  
**I want** the system to detect when new posts are available  
**So that** I can stay updated with the latest content without manually refreshing

### Acceptance Criteria
- System polls or listens for new posts in real-time
- Detection works regardless of which tab/window the user is on
- New post detection is triggered by posts from any user
- System maintains connection state and handles reconnection
- No duplicate notifications for the same posts

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**: Test new post polling service, WebSocket connection handling
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints for new post detection
- **E2E Tests**: Verify real-time detection across multiple browser sessions
- **Manual Tests**: Test behavior with poor network conditions

## Story 2: Notification Banner Display
**As a** user with new posts available  
**I want** to see a notification at the top of my screen  
**So that** I know there are new posts without losing my current position

### Acceptance Criteria
- Notification appears at the top of the screen when new posts are detected
- Message displays "New Posts, Press . to load"
- Banner is visually distinct and attention-grabbing
- Banner persists until user takes action
- Banner doesn't interfere with existing UI elements
- Only shows when there are actually new posts

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**: Test notification component rendering, visibility states
- **Integration Tests**: Test notification trigger conditions
- **E2E Tests**: Verify banner appearance and positioning across devices
- **Manual Tests**: Test visual design and accessibility compliance

---

## Story 3: Keyboard Shortcut Handling
**As a** user who sees the new posts notification  
**I want** to press the "." key to load new posts  
**So that** I can quickly access new content using a keyboard shortcut

### Acceptance Criteria
- "." key press is detected when notification is visible
- Keyboard shortcut works regardless of current focus (within app)
- Shortcut only responds when notification banner is present
- Key press triggers post loading and scrolling action
- Works with different keyboard layouts
- Doesn't conflict with existing shortcuts

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**: Test keypress event handlers, shortcut detection
- **Integration Tests**: Test keyboard event to action mapping
- **E2E Tests**: Verify shortcut works across different browsers/OS
- **Manual Tests**: Test with various keyboard layouts and accessibility tools

## Story 4: Post Refresh and Scroll
**As a** user who pressed "." to load new posts  
**I want** the page to scroll to the top and show the new posts  
**So that** I can immediately see the latest content

### Acceptance Criteria
- Page scrolls smoothly to the top when "." is pressed
- New posts are loaded and displayed at the top of the feed
- Scroll animation is smooth and not jarring
- Notification banner disappears after loading
- User can distinguish new posts from previously loaded ones
- Loading state is shown during the refresh process

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**: Test scroll functions, post loading logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test API calls for fetching new posts
- **E2E Tests**: Verify complete user flow from notification to loaded posts
- **Manual Tests**: Test scroll behavior on different screen sizes

---

## Story 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases
**As a** user experiencing network issues or errors  
**I want** the notification system to handle failures gracefully  
**So that** I have a consistent experience even when things go wrong

### Acceptance Criteria
- System handles network disconnections gracefully
- Failed post loads show appropriate error messages
- Retry mechanism for failed operations
- System recovers automatically when connection is restored
- No infinite loading states or broken UI

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**: Test error handling functions, retry logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test API failure scenarios
- **E2E Tests**: Test system behavior with simulated network issues
- **Manual Tests**: Test with actual poor network conditions

## Test Strategy Summary

The test cases follow the **Test Pyramid** principle:

### ðŸ”º **E2E Tests (Top - Few)**
- Complete user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Real-time multi-user scenarios

### ðŸ”³ **Integration Tests (Middle - Moderate)**  
- API endpoint testing
- Component integration
- Service layer interactions

### ðŸ”² **Unit Tests (Bottom - Many)**
- Individual functions
- Component rendering
- Event handlers
- Business logic

### ðŸ“‹ **Manual Tests (Specialized)**
- Accessibility compliance
- Visual design verification  
- Complex edge cases
- Network condition testing

Each story can be developed and tested independently while building toward the complete feature functionality.
