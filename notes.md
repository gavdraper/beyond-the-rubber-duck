Tooling

CoPilot - Multi Model  Easy to integrat and use, opinionated in how it works
Claude Code - Not opinionated, VERY configurable
Chat GPT - Much less integrated with your workin environment, General Purpose
Gemini - New Tool, Going direction of Claude Code but with Google models


Context

The AI Has no idea how to write code, its just a VERY fancy predictive text. Given these tokens what's the most likely next token.

Give it exactly the context needed to complete the task its being given, no more or less. 


Refinement
For any task you need to describe the personna you want the AI to take. Use different ones depending on the task.  Some tools allow you to create custom agents for different tasks, others will require you to specify the personna in the prompt/context.

Coding
Think of it as an assistive tool not something that will go away and write perfect code. Find the workflow that works for you and experiment.

Some ideas

- Write tests and ask the AI to write the implementation ensuring the tests pass
- Ask AI to write the tests and then you write the implementation
- Ask AI to write the tests AND the implementation
- Write your own implementation and ask AI to review it

Find what works for you and share it with others.
